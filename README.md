# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Insights

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
This dataset contains information about bank customers and their churn status, which indicates whether they have exited the bank or not.Banks often struggle with understanding why customers choose to leave, which can lead to lost revenue and increased costs from constantly needing to attract new customers. High churn rates can also signal deeper issues with customer satisfaction or engagement. This project focuses on uncovering customer churn by analysing patterns in customer behavior and demographics. The task at hand is to provide clear insights and practical recommendations to help banks keep their customers happy and loyal.

# KEY INSIGHTS
* The bank's overall churn rate stands at **20.40%**, indicating that one in five customers has exited the bank.
* A significant **56.2%** of customers aged between **51-60** have churned, compared to only **5.6%** of customers under **20** years old, suggesting that current marketing strategies are resonating more with the younger generation.
* Customers with a credit score of **400** or less have a **100%** churn rate, while churn decreases significantly for customers with higher credit scores. The lowest churn rate, **19.7%**, is observed among customers with credit scores exceeding **800**, highlighting the stability of this group.
* All customers with balances between **$1,000** and **$10,000** exited the bank. Interestingly, **55.9%** of customers with balances over **$200,000** also churned, which may indicate concerns about the bank’s ability to safeguard large deposits. This suggests a potential gap in the brand’s messaging around financial security.
* Customer churn correlates strongly with the number of products held. A striking **82.67%** of customers with 3 products exited, while **100%** of those with 4 products churned. This could point to issues with the usability or satisfaction across the product suite. In contrast, only **27.7%** of customers with 1 product and **7.7%** of customers with 2 products churned.
# BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
* **Enhance Marketing Strategies for Older Generations**: Focused efforts are needed to engage customers aged **51-60**, including tailored communication and benefits that align with their needs and preferences.
* **Reinforce Brand Identity Around Financial Security**: Campaigns should be restructured to emphasize the bank’s ability to protect customers' assets, particularly targeting high-balance account holders.
* **Prioritize User Experience Across Products**: Conduct a thorough review of all product touchpoints to ensure consistent and high-quality user experiences. Special attention should be given to improving the usability of products held by multi-product customers to address the higher churn rates in this group.
