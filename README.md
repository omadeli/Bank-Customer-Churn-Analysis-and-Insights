# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Insights

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
This dataset contains information about bank customers and their churn status, which indicates whether they have exited the bank or not.Banks often struggle with understanding why customers choose to leave, which can lead to lost revenue and increased costs from constantly needing to attract new customers. High churn rates can also signal deeper issues with customer satisfaction or engagement. This project focuses on uncovering customer churn by analysing patterns in customer behavior and demographics. The goal is to provide clear insights and practical recommendations to help banks keep their customers happy and loyal

# KEY INSIGHTS
* The overall churn rate is **20.40%**, meaning **20.40%** of the customers exited the bank
* **56.2%** customers aged between **51-60** exited the bank, while only **5.6%** of customers less than **20years** old exited the bank. This might be an indication that the marketing strategies are working on the younger generation
* All customers with a credit score of **400** or less exited the bank while other credit score groups exhibited a stable churn rate with customers having a credit score greater than 800 having the lowest churn rate at **19.7%**
* All customers having **1-10k** balance had exited the bank. It is also exciting to know that **55.9%** percent of customers with a balance greater **$200,000** exited the bank, this might suggest that customers of  with such amount might feel that thier money is not secured which also indicates that the brand identity is not communicating financial security enough
* **82.67%** of customers with 3 products exited the bank while **100%** of customers with 4 products also exited the bank. This can be connect to bad user experience on some of the products
* **27.7%** of customers with 1 product exited the bank, while **7.7%** of customers with 2 exited the bank
# BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS
* Marketing strategies should be developed to connect with the older generation.
* Brand identity and Ad Campaigns should be restrutered to showcase and emphasise financial security.
* Efforts should be made to make sure user experience is top notch and similar across all products and platforms.
