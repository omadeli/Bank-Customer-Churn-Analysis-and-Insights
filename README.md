# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-and-Insights
This project focused on analysing customer churn in the banking sector to understand why customers leave and how to address it.  The insights from the analysis were summarised into actionable recommendations to help banks reduce churn, improve customer satisfaction, and better target their retention efforts.
